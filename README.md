Sailfactor
==========

Sailfactor is a tool for finding the factors of an integer, step by step.

The project files are based on Helloworld Pro Sailfish, and some references to it may still be present within the project files.

Motivation
----------

The motivation behind Sailfactor was for the author to learn about Sailfish and QML, and create something simple but unique for Sailfish -- something simple enough to complete within a few weeks as a hobby project. The command line tool `factor' from GNU Coreutils was a source of inspiration.


Known bugs and limitations
----------

Currently, the tests are not suitable for testing this project.
Number range is limited to [-9999999,9999999] due to performance, factorizing larger integers is too slow.
